26,xa1fcr,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdEBQsE_YKw,"I put this film together over the last year using the best source footage and audio I could find. Much of it was secured via NIST-FOIA and sites like Enhanced WTC on YouTube (massive thanks to whomever owns that channel). We gently restored the quality of the video and audio and I also wrote some music to underscore the events. I hope this serves to put the best of the best material of the day in one place. Also, YouTube censored it so you have to agree to consent before watching."
27,xa1fcr,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdEBQsE_YKw,"What are your thoughts on the events? Do you subscribe to the 9/11 Commision Report findings? As we go into the weekend, I'll be watching your film and many others to remember this day and keep searching for the truth."
28,xa1fcr,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdEBQsE_YKw,Incredible job with the video
29,xa1fcr,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdEBQsE_YKw,"That's a great question. I spent most of 2018-2019 speaking with many who believe the events were planned by the US government, and the more I looked, the more evidence the conspiracy theorists seemed to have. Especially since we have quite possibly the worst footage of the Pentagon impact imaginable...for one of the highest security buildings in DC...after all these years, why do we not have the actual footage of the impact? Some say it exists and I could not locate it. I initially had issues with the collapse of WTC7, too. It looked too clean. Too simple.

When I learned more about how WTC1,2 and 7 were constructed, it made much more sense to me that once several floors had burned out, the exterior walls no longer had the support they needed to stand. So I do believe the fires, though they did not necessarily melt the steel (which is where I differ from the 9/11 commission), they burned through the floors which allowed the steel columns to collapse since the exterior walls had no horizontal support to hold them upright. I believe the fires weakened the steel, but did not melt it, and that weakened steel was enough to initiate a top down collapse for buildings 1 and 2. Building 7 is an odd one to me and I do not know if the fires created a top down to bottom up collapse. Several security guards at the memorial believe building 7 was planned.

So, personally,, after spending the last few years combing through the footage and listening to the calls and radio transmissions meticulously, I don't believe it was a conspiracy. I believe the events happened due to terrorism, and that our government has done a poor job of releasing adequate material to counter the conspiracy arguments, which will always have grounding until they go unproven. Our leadership at the time also over-reacted and thrust us into a series of military occupations that coming generations will be paying for their entire lives - psychologically, physically and monetarily. Our exit from Afghanistan in particular does no favors to offering a sense of closure to the victims and families.

How about you?"
30,xa1fcr,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdEBQsE_YKw,Thank you so much. Mitchell and I worked hard to honor the families and victims with every frame.
31,xa1fcr,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdEBQsE_YKw,"What a fantastic response, thank you. You're very measured in how you discuss this, I like that. I respect the amount of time you've put into research as well, which is quite rare on this very divisive topic. 

Honestly my views on this are so distorted I'm not even sure where I stand. What I know is that if it was an act of terrorism in a macabre way they didn't yield a lot of kills, especially when you consider what they actually did. Imagine the plane plowing down a busy street that time of day. It makes more sense to me to do that if it was a kill yield attack. Much more collateral damage. 

The buildings were described as ""precious US targets"".  That vernacular to me doesn't equate with what the perpetrators would consider to be precious. Terrorism for Al Qaeda is destruction of precious US targets? Surely its to retaliate in the name of their religion as ""religious extremists"" and ""evildoers"". If it was a flex of power and an indication of their extremism, why have similar events not taken place since? 

I believe the event was staged, but the exact reasons why  still elude me. What I just wrote is a tiny amount of what I have researched myself, albeit from online sources. It started with Dylan Avery - Loose Change. So maybe I was conditioned from that point, because I hadn't seen the alternative. I think that was the point of the event though, to polarize and divide people in their hearts and minds and cultivate opposition against anything connected to 911 official reports and events thereafter. Too much of the official reaction was dismissive and ignorant. ""Now watch this drive"" - George W. Bush. 

I think more simply my answer is this: you don't need to be an analytical person to see that the Pentagon attack should be held under suspicion, as a component of the rest of the attacks and by proxy all of 911 should be under suspicion because to date, no official evidence has fully explored the entire event and released what victims have been asking for, for 21 years. 

I'm not arguing or being hostile by the way, I really respect you."

It leaks like a sieve. It can barely send social security checks on time. Also, the USG is staffed by middle class public servants. They‚Äôre not going out of their way to cover up killing their fellow Americans. The reality is this happened because the US intelligence services in the 90s were incompetent."
33,xa1fcr,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdEBQsE_YKw,"I respect what you're saying I really do. More than that, I believe you. I just have this awful niggling. There's so many little stings about that day. The squibs indicating demolition as each tower fell at free fall speed. The impossible manoeuvres of the ""aircraft"" that hit the Pentagon. The explosions from the basement and lobby just before planes impact the towers. Some things can be explained away by incompetence of a global superpower. Some things just seem to defy laws of physics and those are the things that should be focused on. One thing we all agree on is the loss of life was devastating for all."

WTC 1/2/7 all were under remodeling and who was in charge of the security for those buildings? Securacom. Securacom also provided security for United Airlines. There were reports of people seeing people moving boxes and other large items into the towers in the middle of the night during those remodeling periods. The Bush family is tied to Securacom by Marvin Bush. When you have a security contract you know exactly when and how to get away with setting that up, especially if there were people moving stuff into the towers late into the night. If I can remember correctly that report of seeing that happen stated that it was a common occurrence during the remodeling. If I can leave you with one thought - none of those hijackers could fly a commercial plane let alone 767s and of course the 767s hit the towers instead of the 757s. If it doesn‚Äôt make sense it isn‚Äôt true. The only explanation is a modified scenario of operation north woods."

Please don't over simplify anything remotely related to 911 because it don't help.

The video shows that there was sufficient evidence to show that the ""molted steel"" existed (unless you choose to ignore it or the NIST labs were ground zero for the Mandela Effect.)

What's more interesting is, if the official story is true, it means that all those people talking about sounds of explosions in that moment as it was happening were wrong."
69,wm1enu,https://v.redd.it/kuop44gu85h91,"First things first. We would have to prove the planned demolition before the ""who."" Right?

For example, if you found your mom's dead body in your parents house, the first thing to do is determine if it was death by murder or natural causes. If there was evidence that someone in your family killed her, you can't ignore it just because you don't like the outcome.

But I guess you could.

On a side note, what do you think about all the people talking about the sounds of explosions and then the investigators say that there were no witnesses claiming to have heard explosions.

I love America but our government (spoiler\* person of interest) lies to us all the time.

96,wjjht4,https://i.redd.it/6bt93iy3wjg91.jpg,This isnt working. You need to convince us that tslking about this is insensitive because your family perished in the attacks. Always works on other posts.

2. Shoop in planes

106,whm1t4,https://www.reddit.com/r/911/comments/whm1t4/does_anyone_have_any_pictures_of_the_twin_towers/,I doubt those exist. This was before the days of smart phones and they were office buildings. Most people didn‚Äôt bring a camera to work on a random day. Also this 8 o‚Äôclock is before most tourists would have arrived So you‚Äôre not looking at too much in the way of cameras being inside the building and then many of those on the floor with the fires didn‚Äôt make it out. Whose who did were more concerned with living. If it had occurred 10 years later they would‚Äôve been a lot. But in 2001 not so much.

108,whm1t4,https://www.reddit.com/r/911/comments/whm1t4/does_anyone_have_any_pictures_of_the_twin_towers/,There is a video of the plane practically on the roof of the Pentagon moments before it hit. I would think there would be SOME pictures of the inside.
